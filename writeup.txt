Process:

I first defined the problem and created a workflow for solving it. 

Problem: Get the message from the page, hash it, and then send it back within 2 seconds.

I divided my code into 4 steps.

1. Login to the site and get the challenge page content

2. Parse the page content down to just the message

3. Hash the message into a hash object

4. Send the hashed message back to challenge page
