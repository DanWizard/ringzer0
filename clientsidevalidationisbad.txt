The front end JS had this section of code

p = String.fromCharCode(74,97,118,97,83,99,114,105,112,116,73,115,83,101,99,117,114,101)

So I put that in a JS file and created a function called gimmeWord where I printed p.

Output: JavaScriptIsSecure

since the username is clearly given as "admin" I compledted the credentials and logged in

Username = admin

Password = JavaScriptIsSecure
